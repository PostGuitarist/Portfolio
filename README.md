# Zaden's Portfolio
### Responsive Portfolio
A clean and nice web portfolio for me. Includes almost everything needed to show. At first, my name, links to social networks and an image. Then the About section displays more information. Then the list of Skills. It also has a section where it shows some recent work. And at the bottom it has a form, and at the end with a footer.
