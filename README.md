# Zaden's Portfolio
### A Complete Responsive Portfolio
For myself, a developer, this is a simple and attractive web portfolio. Almost everything I wish to exhibit fits under this category. First and foremost, my name, social media links, and an image. Then there's the About section, which displays more information. Then there's the Skills list. It also includes a section that showcases some current work. Lastly, it also features a form at the bottom, as well as a footer at the end.
